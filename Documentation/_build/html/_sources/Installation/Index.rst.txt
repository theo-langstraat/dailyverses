Installation
============

Although a `composer.json` file has been added by Kickstarter, installation via Composer has not yet been fully tested.  
For now, the plugin is added to the TYPO3 installation using the traditional method via the Extension Manager in the TYPO3 backend.

After installation, make sure to clear all caches.

Requirements
------------

- TYPO3 v13 or higher  
- PHP 8.3 or higher  
- Bootstrap Package 15.0 or higher
